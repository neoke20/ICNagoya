          <h3 class="pb-3">1. Contract offer and formation</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>An offer is made when the School sends an estimate in response to a request by the applicant.</li>
            <li>A contract is formed when the applicant communicates to the School intent to pay the sum of money specified in the
            estimate received from the School.</li>
            <li>If the applicant wishes to be released from the contract, he must contact the School directly and request to be released
            from the contract.</li>
          </ol>

        <div id="card2" class="rounded bg-white p-5 mb-4 terms-card">
          <h3 class="pb-3">2. Reasons for refusal of application</h3>
          <p>The School reserves the right to refuse any application without reason, at the sole discretion of the school. In particular, applicants will be refused in the following cases:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The applicant is under 18, and the applicant's parent or legal guardian has not given verifiable permission to study.</li>
            <li>The requested course is unavailable or full. (The School alone determines availability.)</li>
            <li>The time to complete the procedures to apply for the requested course is insufficient. (We ask people to apply at least
            one month in advance. However, shorter notice is possible, especially if accommodation is not required.)</li>
            <li>The School judges that the applicant's medical history, or current physical or mental status, are not suited to the pressures of the course of study.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div id="card3" class="rounded bg-white p-5 mb-4 terms-card">
          <h3 class="pb-3">3. Extent of duty of the school</h3>
          <p>The School, upon receiving the application, will perform the following duties:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Furnishing of information</strong><p>
              Upon receiving the application, the School will provide timely information to the applicant in response to the applicant's questions or requests.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Living arrangement procedures</strong><p>
            The School will prepare accommodation when requested, taking the preferences of the applicant into consideration. However, if it is not possible to find accommodation that meets the needs of the applicant (with regards to type, as
            well as specific needs such as diet, smoking, etc.), the School may ask the applicant to consider alternate accommodation types. If the applicant is not willing to accept alternate accommodation, the applicant can choose to withdraw from the contract without penalty, as described in these terms. In some cases, 2 or more students may stay at
            the same accommodation simultaneously.</p>
            <p>If it is not possible to secure the requested accommodation due to factors beyond the control of the School (for example, illness in the selected host family), the School can not accept responsibility. In this case, the School will arrange alternate accommodation, or refund the full accommodation fee and work with the student to arrange alternate
            accommodation, or allow the student to withdraw from the program.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Accommodation is contracted directly between the applicant and the accommodation provider, NOT the School. The School acts as the contract facilitator. In case of contractual claims related to accommodation, the School will do all in our power to help, but the contractual responsibility lies with the accommodation provider, and the School cannot accept responsibility for provisions outside the terms of this contract.</li>
                <li>For example, if the student wishes to cancel the accommodation early, there may be a cancellation fee levied by the accommodation provider, in addition to any School cancellation fees provided for in these Terms. Clarify with the accommodation provider in advance, if you do not receive notification.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>

          <h3 class="pb-3">4. Fees</h3>
          <p>The fees listed below are not included in the invoice, and will be charged separately depending on request and/or requirement.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Lodging fee</strong>
              <p>If the applicant arrives earlier than the date that accommodation starts, or leaves after the date that accommodation ends, where possible the School will arrange for the period of accommodation to be extended. The applicant must pay the additional costs in this case. However, when this is not possible, the applicant will be required to arrange
            accommodation for the extra nights, at the applicant's own expense.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Meal fees</strong>
              <p>In the absence of any agreement to the contrary, breakfast only is provided at the homestay destination. No meals are provided at other accommodation types. The applicant is responsible for the cost of other meals.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Travel fees</strong>
              <p>The applicant is responsible for costs incurred in traveling from the accommodation to the School</p>
            <li><strong>Alteration fee</strong>
              <p>If the applicant requests to change the date or duration of study, an alteration fee may be required at the discretion of the school. Depending on conditions, the requested change may not be possible. Please confirm with the School as early as possible.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Bank charges/transfer fees</strong>
              <p>If the received payment is less than the billed amount, for any reason, the applicant will be required to pay the difference.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Other considerations</strong>
              <ol>
                <li>Exchange rate fluctuations
                  <p>All billing is done in Japanese yen. When values in other currencies are provided, they are only for informational purposes, and do not form part of the contract. Final payment must be made in yen, and changes in the exchange rate (e.g., between the date of billing and the date of payment) are the responsibility of the applicant.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Payment of the fees
                  <p>All fees specified in this Agreement must be paid in full by the agreed method to the School to be received by the specified date (generally one calendar month before the first day of study). If fees are not received by the specified date, the School reserves the right to cancel the applicant’s enrollment.</p>
                </li>

          <ol>
            <li>The School may cancel the programme contract in accordance with this Agreement upon notifying the applicant, if any of the following causes are established.
              <ol>
                <li>If necessary documents requested of the applicant are not received by the specified date.</li>
                <li>If fees billed to the applicant are not paid by the specified date.</li>
                <li>If the school is unable to contact the applicant for a period of more than 30 days.
</li>
                <li>If documents submitted to the School by the applicant are found to contain a falsehood, or a vital omission, including omission of diagnosed medical conditions.</li>
                <li>Any other reason, as decided solely by the School.</li>
                <li>If the applicant does not obey the laws of Japan and school rules, or does not comply with orders and matters decided by the school administration.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>If the School cancels a contract based on any of the items above, matters will be dealt with as provided for in the section [Cancellation and return of fees after application] below.</li>
            <li>In the case that the applicant is refused accommodation due to conduct that is in violation of accommodation rules that the applicant was previously informed of, or behavior that obviously contravenes social standards, the fee for the remaining period of accommodation will not be reimbursed to the applicant.</li>
            <li>You must attend 85% or more of your scheduled classes. If you do not meet this standard without a valid reason as decided by the school, school staff will discuss ways to improve the situation. If your attendance rate remains below the requirement, you may be asked to move to a lower class or asked to leave the school.</li>

          <h3 class="pb-3">6. Exemption from responsibility</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>If any of the following causes result in the applicant being unable to study, the date of study being changed, or any other problem, we will do our best to work with the applicant to make alternate arrangements; however if arrangements can not be made, the School will not accept legal responsibility.
              <ol>
                <li>If the requested accommodation is full and therefore unavailable.</li>
                <li>If the applicant is unable to receive a passport or visa, or is refused entry to Japan.</li>
                <li>If the date of departure is changed due to delays in receiving a passport or visa.</li>
                <li>In cases of disaster (including adverse weather requiring school closure), war, strike, terrorism, unforeseen circumstances, or Acts of God.</li>
                <li>If study is considered impossible due to the health of the applicant.</li>
                <li>Accident, fire, disaster (including adverse weather requiring school closure), fraud or injury during the period of study.</li>

              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The School can not accept responsibility for any travel-related accident occurring during travel. The applicant should be sure to enroll in overseas travel insurance.</li>
            <li>The School can not accept responsibility for any physical, mental or economic damages suffered by the student from causes beyond the control of the School.</li>
            <li>The School will require payment of damages from the applicant in the case that the applicant's intended action has the result of causing losses to the School or other losses due to violation of law or ordinance.</li>

            <li>From time of arrival in Japan, the applicant is responsible for the applicant's own actions, and is personally liable for any damages arising from actions in breach of laws, regulations, customs, or the rules of the School. In any of these cases, the school can not accept responsibility. The applicant is responsible for any accidents occurring during activities such as sports, and is responsible for purchasing additional insurance for any sports requiring such. In any case corresponding to any of the above conditions, the School will under no circumstances return fees (admission fee, tuition fee, alteration fee, etc.).</li>
            <li>By booking your study with the School, you agree to arrange applicable travel insurance to cover medical and property damage costs. Most international visitors are not entitled to publicly funded health services while in Japan. If you receive medical treatment during your visit, you may be liable for the full costs of that treatment.</li>
            <li>If you require a transcript that includes an evaluation of you, you must request this before or during your study. If transcripts are requested after your study has finished, we may not be able to provide them, or we may only be able to provide documentation of your study period, not an evaluation.</li>

          <h3 class="pb-3">7. Cancellation and refunds</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>The applicant may withdraw from the programme at any time. However, depending on the date of cancellation, a cancellation fee may be required.</li>
            <li>The amount returned to the applicant will be calculated based on the yen value originally received, regardless of changes in the exchange rate since original payment.</li>
            <li>If the total of expenses and losses is more than the amount previously paid by the applicant to the School, the School will bill the applicant separately for the additional sum.</li>
            <li>If you shorten your study with the school, you must also leave any accommodation prepared by the school.</li>
            <li>While the School will make every effort to refund fees promptly, no guarantee as to the date of refund will be made.</li>
            <li>In cases where a third party has paid all or part of the student's fees, the permission of the third party is required before the school can refund directly to the student.</li>
            <li>Refunded fees depend on the specific timing and situation. Refunds are handled strictly.
